# Pest-Invasion-Game--
Prototype &amp; Progress for Game Dev Final Project.

"Pest Invasion" is a roguelike dungeon crawler where you play as a heroic cockroach battling against a horde of "enemies" in a procedural world. The player will navigate randomly generated levels, collect weapons, and fight unique enemies while using a dash mechanic to avoid danger. The game is meant to combines fast-paced top-down action with strategic character switching, offering a chaotic and challenging experience.

As of now, accomplished tasks include:

•	Player Control: The player can move using WASD or arrow keys, aim with the mouse, and shoot with the left mouse button. Movement is smooth with animations for idle, moving, and dashing. Shooting is implemented with an auto-fire feature, and bullets have impact effects.

•	Enemies: Basic enemies with idle and movement animations have been implemented. They can shoot at the player, deal damage, and show hurt and death animations, including a death splatter effect.

•	Health & Damage System: The player has a visible health bar, temporary invincibility after being hit, and a death screen upon reaching 0 health. Enemies can take damage and die.

•	Dashing & Smashing: Dashing works with invincibility frames and box-shattering effects, with animations for dashing. Health pickups can be dropped when boxes are destroyed. Couches as well.

•	Rooms & Level Flow: The game consists of multiple rooms connected by Tilemaps. Doors close when entering a room and open after all enemies are defeated, and a basic level sequence with a fade-out after completing the level is in place.

•	Menus: A title screen, pause menu, victory screen, and death screen are fully implemented.

•	Audio: Music and sound effects have been partially added and assigned to actions like shooting and breaking boxes.
